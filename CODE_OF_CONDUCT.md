# LY Corporation's Open Source Code of Conduct

This Code of Conduct describes the expected standards of behavior for participants, and is intended to help foster a welcoming, safe, and productive open source community.

## Core Principles of Conduct

### Be Respectful

Respect is the foundation of our community. All participants should respect the diverse backgrounds, experiences, skill levels, and viewpoints of others, and should approach differences of opinion with tolerance and understanding.

### Be Constructive in Communication

Communication should always be courteous, clear, and professional. Participants should avoid aggressive or demeaning expressions, listen carefully, and ask for clarification or raise questions as needed to reduce misunderstandings.

When disagreements arise, discussions should remain focused on technical issues and project goals, not on individuals. Feedback should be provided in a constructive and respectful manner.

### Maintain a Safe and Supportive Environment

To maintain a safe community environment, we ask all participants to avoid any form of harassment, intimidation, threats, or deliberate disruption of discussions or collaborative activities.

All participants are responsible for helping maintain a safe and supportive atmosphere.

## Reporting and Handling of Concerns

If you experience or observe behavior that is inconsistent with this Code of Conduct, you are encouraged to share your concerns with us at [Mailing List Address].
 Any member of the community may report an issue, even if they were not the target of the harm.

All reports will be kept confidential and secure. Reported cases will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.
